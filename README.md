# Basic Concepts in Computer Science

## Operation System

### Memory
- Cache

### Threads and Concurrency
- Optimistic locks and pessimistic locks
- Lock-free concurrent data structures(e.g. Queue)
- Conditional variable(C++ 11)
- Linux IO multiplex(select/poll/epoll)
- Thread memory model(e.g. x86)


## Database
- Transaction isolation level
    - Read uncommitted
    - Read committed
    - Repeatable read
    - Serializable

## Security

## Network
- Four types of NATs
    - Full cone
    - Restricted cone
    - Port restricted cone
    - Symmetric

- NAT punch-through
